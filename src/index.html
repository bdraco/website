<h2>Open standard for Wi-Fi provisioning via Bluetooth LE</h2>
<p>
  Improv is a free and open standard with ready-made SDKs that offer a great
  user experience to configure Wi-Fi on devices.
</p>
<p>
  With Improv creators can offer a better onboarding experience when they share
  their creations with others:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Connect gadget to power.</li>
  <li>
    Client application uses Improv to sent the Wi-Fi credentials to the gadget.
  </li>
  <li>
    The gadget will connect to the wireless network and return it's IP address.
  </li>
  <li>
    Client application guides user to continue setting up the gadget.<br />
    (this step is not part of the Improv standard)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Improv provisioning also works in browsers that support WebBluetooth<span
    class="not-supported"
    >. Your browser is not supported, try with Google Chrome or Microsoft
    Edge<span class="not-supported-i"></span>.</span
  >

<h3>The problem we're solving</h3>

<p>
  Getting your Wi-Fi gadget connected to the internet is a bad user experience.
</p>

<p>
  A lot of devices require an internet connection to be controlled or receive
  data, both locally and in the cloud. The majority of the devices use Wi-Fi to
  establish a connection.
</p>

<p>
  Configuring a device to connect to your Wi-Fi is a pain. The most common
  approach is Soft Enabled Access Point. The device starts its own Wi-Fi access
  point, the user connects to it with their phone/computer and then interacts
  directly with the device via an app or a website served from the device.
</p>

<p>
  It’s easy for something to go wrong. The user submits incorrect Wi-Fi
  credentials or the phone loses access to the access point. In such cases it is
  difficult to recover. Phones also have a bad time dealing with access points
  that don’t provide internet access.
</p>

<h3>Scope and constraints</h3>
<p>
  The goal of the standard is to get the device connected to the Wi-Fi via
  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is not the goal to offer a way for devices to
  share data or control. The standard should work without requiring the device
  to contain a screen.
