## Code to provision Improv devices

These examples will help you create clients that can provision devices hosting the Improv BLE service.

### SDK for JavaScript

The SDK for JavaScript contains everything you need to offer Improv provisioning on your website. Simply get started by adding the following HTML snippet:

```js
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://www.improv-wifi.com/sdk-js/launch-button.js"
></script>

<improv-wifi-launch-button></improv-wifi-launch-button>
```

This results in:

> <improv-wifi-launch-button></improv-wifi-launch-button>

You can also replace the default button by passing your own HTML:

```js
<improv-wifi-launch-button>
  <button><img src="/images/home-assistant.svg" width="50"></button>
</improv-wifi-launch-button>
```

This results in:

> <improv-wifi-launch-button>
>   <button><img src="/images/home-assistant.svg" width="50"></button>
> </improv-wifi-launch-button>

The source code for the JavaScript SDK is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/improv-wifi/sdk-js) and can also be installed from NPM using `npm install --save improv-wifi-sdk`.
